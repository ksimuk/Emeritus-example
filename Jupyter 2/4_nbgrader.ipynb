    "nbgrader is a Jupyter notebook grading system. With nbgrader, you can add auto-graded or manually graded asessments. Manually graded assessments can be code-based or free response. You have the ability to set the number of points for each question, and you can override a grade if need be. Assessments are added directly to a notebook, and there is no need to do a system exit (all or nothing questions) or an HTTP request (partial points) as is required for advanced code tests in the Guide. Be sure to check out the [Codio documentation](https://docs.codio.com/courses/g\n",
    "rading/#nbgrader-autograding) on nbgrader for more information.\n",
